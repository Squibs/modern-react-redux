# Song selector with redux

- introduction to redux
- had fears from the last time I was trying to learn react / redux come back
  - folder structure was a large point for me to get over when trying to learn redux
- `mapStateToProps` and `connect`
- actions, reducers, types/constants, redux store
- learning typescript on top of react and redux was a real challenge
