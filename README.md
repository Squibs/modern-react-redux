# Learning React and Redux with Stephen Grider's _Modern React With Redux_, and I Threw Typescript in for Myself as Well.

I have notes inside each project folder of what I think was most important for me to learn. I wish I had started this repo earlier while going through the lessons / projects provided by Stephen Grider's Udemy course. It would have allowed me to record better notes for myself, but as it is I am already quite happy, especially with how project 9 is going/went.

I had originally taken some of this course a while back, and fell out of learning React and Redux. It was a lot to learn at the time, and I needed time to grow/learn before coming back. The lessons offered in Stephen's course changed a lot from the first time I went through and this second go at it went so much better than my previous attempt.

Throwing TypeScript on-top of everything a few projects in proved to be a challenge, but I'm glad I did it. I plan on continuing to use typescript, as I have definitely seen how it can help; although it is still a pain to use at times.
